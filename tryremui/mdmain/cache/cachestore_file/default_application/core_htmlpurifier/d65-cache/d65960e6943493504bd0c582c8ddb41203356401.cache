s:882:"<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Organic chemistry is the study of “living” things—not in the same way that biology is the study of life. Rather, organic chemistry takes a look at what composes the living things, and how they’re structured. Organic chemistry breaks down living things not only into organs seen in organisms, but goes a step further to break down those organs into atoms and molecules. It focuses mainly on carbon, which is highly essential to maintaining life, and particularly zeroes in on the hydrocarbon, which is a molecule composed of hydrogen and carbon. Hydrocarbons not only compose what we’re made of, but also what we consume, including carbohydrates, proteins, steroids, fats, and more! As a matter of fact, you may be surprised to know that everyday things, such as caffeine, plastic, and paint are all composed of hydrocarbons!<br /></p>";
