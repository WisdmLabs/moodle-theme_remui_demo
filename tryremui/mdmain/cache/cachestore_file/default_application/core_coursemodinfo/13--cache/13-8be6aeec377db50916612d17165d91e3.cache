Why do we feel and act differently in different types of social situations? Why might people of a single group exhibit different behaviors in the same situation? Why might people acting similarly not feel connected to others exhibiting the same behavior?

schooling affects a person’s later success in college or how many people
 wait until they are in their forties to get married? Do you wonder if 
texting is changing teenagers’ abilities to spell correctly or to 
communicate clearly? How do social movements like Occupy Wall Street 
develop? How about the development of social phenomena like the massive 
public followings for Star Trek and Harry Potter? The goal of research 
is to answer questions. Sociological research attempts to answer a vast 
variety of questions, such as these and more, about our social world.</p><p>We
 often have opinions about social situations, but these may be biased by
 our expectations or based on limited data. Instead, scientific research
 is based on empirical evidence, which is evidence that comes from 
direct experience, scientifically gathered data, or experimentation. 
Many people believe, for example, that crime rates go up when there’s a 
full moon, but research doesn’t support this opinion. Researchers Rotton
 and Kelly (1985) conducted a meta-analysis of research on the full 
moon’s effects on behavior. Meta-analysis is a technique in which the 
results of virtually all previous studies on a specific subject are 
evaluated together. Rotton and Kelly’s meta-analysis included 
thirty-seven prior studies on the effects of the full moon on crime 
rates, and the overall findings were that full moons are entirely 
unrelated to crime, suicide, psychiatric problems, and crisis center 
calls (cited in Arkowitz and Lilienfeld 2009). We may each know of an 
instance in which a crime happened during a full moon, but it was likely
 just a coincidence.</p><p>People 
commonly try to understand the happenings in their world by finding or 
creating an explanation for an occurrence. Social scientists may develop
 a hypothesis for the same reason. A hypothesis is a testable educated 
guess about predicted outcomes between two or more variables; it’s a 
possible explanation for specific happenings in the social world and 
allows for testing to determine whether the explanation holds true in 
many instances, as well as among various groups or in different places. 
Sociologists use empirical data and the scientific method, or an 
interpretative framework, to increase understanding of societies and 
social interactions, but research begins with the search for an answer 
to a question.</p><br><p></p><br><p></p>";s:12:"availability";s:28:"{"op":"&","c":[],"showc":[]}";}i:3;O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:2:"id";s:2:"60";s:4:"name";s:7:"Culture";s:7:"summary";s:2843:"<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"></p><p><img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/interracial-group-women-background_23-2147982749_cleanup.jpg" alt="Alt text" class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" width="540" height="571"><br></p><p>What are the rules when you pass an acquaintance at school, work, in the grocery store, or in the mall? Generally, we do not consider all of the intricacies of the rules of behavior. We may simply say, “Hello!” and ask, “How was your weekend?” or some other trivial question meant to be a friendly greeting. Rarely do we physically embrace or even touch the individual. In fact, doing so may be viewed with scorn or distaste, since as people in the United States we have fairly rigid rules about personal space. However, we all adhere to various rules and standards that are created and maintained in culture. These rules and expectations have meaning, and there are ways in which you may violate this negotiation. Consider what would happen if you stopped and informed everyone who said, “Hi, how are you?” exactly how you were doing that day, and in detail. You would more than likely violate rules of culture and specifically greeting. Perhaps in a different culture the question would be more literal, and it may require a response. Or if you are having coffee with a good friend, perhaps that question warrants a more detailed response. These examples are all aspects of culture, which is shared beliefs, values, and practices, that participants must learn. Sociologically, we examine in what situation and context certain behavior is expected, and in which situations perhaps it is not. These rules are created and enforced by people who interact and share culture.</p><p>In everyday conversation, people rarely distinguish between the terms culture and society, but the terms have slightly different meanings, and the distinction is important to a sociologist. A society describes a group of people who share a community and a culture. By “community,” sociologists refer to a definable region—as small as a neighborhood (Brooklyn, or “the east side of town”), as large as a country (Ethiopia, the United States, or Nepal), or somewhere in between (in the United States, this might include someone who identifies with Southern or Midwestern society). To clarify, a culture represents the beliefs and practices of a group, while society represents the people who share those beliefs and practices. Neither society nor culture could exist without the other. In this chapter, we examine the relationship between culture and society in greater detail and pay special attention to the elements and forces that shape culture, including diversity and cultural changes. A final discussion touches on the different theoretical perspectives from which sociologists research culture.</p><p></p>";s:12:"availability";s:28:"{"op":"&","c":[],"showc":[]}";}i:4;O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:2:"id";s:2:"61";s:4:"name";s:30:"Society and Social Interaction";s:7:"summary";s:2192:"<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"></p><p><img src="@@PLUGINFILE@@/interracial-group-women-background_23-2147982749_cleanup.jpg" alt="Alt text" class="img-fluid atto_image_button_text-bottom" width="540" height="571"><br></p><p>It was a school day, and Adriana, who was just entering eighth grade, woke up at 6:15 a.m. Before she got out of bed, she sent three text messages. One was to Jenn, who last year had moved five states away to a different time zone. Even though they now lived far apart, the two friends texted on and off every day. Now Adriana wanted to tell Jenn that she liked the new boots in the photo that Jenn had posted on a social media site last night.</p><p>Throughout the day, Adriana used her smart phone to send fifty more texts, but she made no phone calls. She even texted her mother in the next room when she had a question about her homework. She kept in close electronic contact with all of her friends on a daily basis. In fact, when she wasn’t doing homework or attending class, she was chatting and laughing with her friends via texts, tweets, and social media websites. Her smart phone was her main source of social interaction.</p><p>We can consider Adriana a typical teenager in the digital age—she constantly communicates with a large group of people who are not confined to one geographical area. This is definitely one of the benefits of new forms of communication: it is cheap and easy, and you can keep in touch with everyone at the same time. However, with these new forms of communication come new forms of societal interaction.</p><p>As we connect with each other more and more in an online environment, we make less time to interact in person. So the obvious question is this: are these forms of communication good developments in terms of social interaction? Or, if there are negative effects, what will they be? As we shall see, our reliance on electronic communication does have consequences. Beyond popularizing new forms of communication, it also alters the traditional ways in which we deal with conflict, the way we view ourselves in relationship to our surroundings, and the ways in which we understand social status.</p><br><p></p>";s:12:"availability";s:28:"{"op":"&","c":[],"showc":[]}";}}s:9:"shortname";s:4:"SWIC";s:8:"fullname";s:60:"Sociology: Work, Identity, and Inequality, Criminal Behavior";s:6:"format";s:11:"remuiformat";s:16:"enablecompletion";s:1:"1";s:9:"groupmode";s:1:"0";s:14:"groupmodeforce";s:1:"0";s:8:"cacherev";s:10:"1704962355";}s:7:"version";i:1704962355;}
