<p>Apple, Google, or Amazon. Unfortunately, many others will never see their first anniversary. The survivors are those that understand that change is the one constant in the business environment. Those organizations pay attention to the business environment in which they operate and the trends that affect all businesses and then successfully adapt to those trends. In this module, we will meet many businesses, both large and small, profit and not-for-profit, that prosper because they track trends and use them to identify potential opportunities. This ability to manage change is a critical factor in separating the success stories from the tales of business failure.

We begin our study of business by introducing you to the primary functions of a business, the relationship between risk and profits, and the importance of not-for-profit organizations. We’ll also examine the major components of the business environment and how changing demographic, social, political and legal, and competitive factors affect all business organizations. Next, we’ll explore how economies provide jobs for workers and also compete with other businesses to create and deliver products to consumers. You will also learn how governments attempt to influence economic activity through policies such as lowering or raising taxes. Next, we discuss how supply and demand determine prices for goods and services. Finally, we conclude by examining key trends in the business environment, economic systems, and the competitive environment.

Founded nearly a century ago in Rhode Island, Hasbro integrates its CSR efforts throughout the organization with the goal of helping to make the world a better place for children of all ages.</p><p>In 2017, the company achieved the number one spot in the “100 Best Corporate Citizens” rankings, published annually by Corporate Responsibility magazine. Hasbro is no stranger to this achievement; over the past five years, Hasbro has consistently been in the top five spots on this prestigious list—and that is no accident.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe title="Business Ethics: Corporate Social Responsibility" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xoE8XlcDUI8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-elsrc="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xoE8XlcDUI8?feature=oembed"></iframe></p><p>With more than 5,000 employees, Hasbro relies heavily on its strategic brand blueprint to guide its efforts in CSR, innovation, philanthropy, and product development. With a business portfolio that includes such well-known brands as Nerf, Play-Doh, Transformers, Monopoly, and The Game of Life, the company focuses its CSR efforts on four key areas: product safety, environmental sustainability, human rights and ethical sourcing, and community.</p><p>According to the company, product safety is its highest priority. Hasbro uses a five-step quality assurance process that starts with design and then moves to engineering, manufacturing, and packaging. Another key part of product safety at Hasbro is incorporating continuous feedback from both consumers and retailers and insisting that these high standards and quality processes apply to all third-party factories worldwide that manufacture its products.</p><p>Hasbro is also committed to finding new ways to reduce its environmental footprint. Over the past several years, the company has reduced energy consumption, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced water consumption and waste production in its production facilities. In addition, Hasbro has totally eliminated the use of wire ties in all of its product packaging, saving more than 34,000 miles of wire ties—more than enough to wrap around the earth’s circumference.</p><p>Human rights and ethical sourcing remains a key ingredient of Hasbro’s CSR success. Treating people fairly is a core company value, as is working diligently to make great strides in diversity and inclusion at all levels of the organization. Company personnel work closely with third-party factories to ensure that the human rights of all workers in the Hasbro global supply chain are recognized and upheld.</p><p>Philanthropy, corporate giving, and employee volunteering are key components of the Hasbro community. Through its various charitable programs, Hasbro made close to $15 million in financial contributions and product donations in 2016, which reached close to an estimated 4 million children around the globe. Several years ago the company started an annual Global Day of Joy as a way of engaging its employees worldwide in community service. In a recent year, more than 93 percent of Hasbro’s employees participated in service projects in more than 40 countries.</p><p>Hasbro is in the business of storytelling, and its CSR efforts tell the story of an ethical, responsible organization whose mission is to create the world’s best play experiences. Its ability to be accountable for its actions and to help make the world a better place one experience at time continues to make it a highly successful company.</p></p>";s:12:"availability";s:28:"{"op":"&","c":[],"showc":[]}";}i:3;O:8:"stdClass":4:{s:2:"id";s:2:"65";s:4:"name";s:57:"Entrepreneurship: Starting and Managing Your Own Business";s:7:"summary";s:5777:"<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><p>Natalie Tessler has always had an entrepreneurial spirit. After she graduated from New York University’s law school, she began working as a tax attorney for a large firm in Chicago. But Tessler soon realized that this left her feeling unfulfilled. She didn’t want to practice law, and she didn’t want to work for someone else. “I wanted to wake up and be excited for my day,” Tessler said. Not until one night, though, when she was having dinner with a friend who recently had begun a writing career, did she realize it was time. “I was listening to her talk about how much she loved her job. Her passion and excitement—I wanted that. I wanted something that grabbed me and propelled me through the day—and being a lawyer wasn’t it.”</p><p>She began searching for what “it” was. She had a tremendous passion and talent for hospitality, entertaining others, and presentation. Seeking an outlet for that flair, she found the spa industry, and the idea for Spa Space was born.</p><p>“People think that, owning a spa, I’m able to live this glamorous lifestyle,” she laughs. “Owning a spa is nothing like going to one—my nails always are broken from fixing equipment; my back is usually in pain from sitting hunched over a computer trying to figure out the budget or our next marketing promotion.” Tessler is a true entrepreneur, embodying the spirit and drive necessary to see her vision become a reality.</p><p>Tessler wanted to design a spa that focused on something new: creating a comfortable, personalized environment of indulgence while not neglecting the medical technology of proper skin care. “My father’s a dermatologist, so we discussed the importance of making this more than a spa where you can get a frou-frou, smell-good treatment that might actually harm your skin. We both thought it was important to create an experience that is as beneficial for people’s skin as it is for their emotional well-being.” To address this need, Spa Space has a medical advisory board that helps with product selection, treatment design, and staff training.</p><p>Armed with a vision and a plan, Tessler turned her sights toward making it a reality. Spa Space opened in 2001 and has received a great deal of national recognition for its service excellence, unique treatments and products, and its fresh approach to appealing to both men and women. But it hasn’t always been smooth sailing for Spa Space. Tessler had to steer the business through several obstacles, including the 9/11 tragedy just three months after the spa’s grand opening, and then the Great Recession. Tessler learned to adapt her strategy by refining her target market and the services Spa Space offered. Her resiliency enabled the company to not only survive difficult economic periods, but to thrive and grow 17 years later into what the press recognizes as Chicago’s best spa.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><iframe title="10 TIPS FOR STARTING YOUR OWN BUSINESS in 2017" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wxyGeUkPYFM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-elsrc="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wxyGeUkPYFM?feature=oembed" data-gtm-yt-inspected-1_25="true"></iframe></p><p>Tessler recently turned the reins over to Ilana Alberico, another entrepreneur and founder of Innovative Spa Management, a company that has been named twice to Inc. magazine’s list of fastest growing companies. When Alberico met Natalie Tessler and learned about her vision, she was inspired to invest in Spa Space. “Natalie’s vision still resonates . . . I’m inspired to champion her vision into the future.”</p><p>Sources: “Our Team,” https://spaspace.com, accessed February 1, 2018; Jennifer Keishin Armstrong, “Spa Reviews: Spa Space in Chicago,” Day Spa magazine, http://www.dayspamagazine.com, accessed February 1, 2018; “About Us,” https://ismspa.com, accessed February 1, 2018.</p><p>Typical of many who catch the entrepreneurial bug, Natalie Tessler had a vision and pursued it single-mindedly. She is just one of thousands of entrepreneurs from all age groups and backgrounds. Even kids are starting businesses and high-tech firms. College graduates are shunning the corporate world to head out on their own. Downsized employees, midcareer executives, and retirees who have worked for others all their lives are forming the companies they have always wanted to own.</p><p>Companies started by entrepreneurs and small-business owners make significant contributions to the U.S. and global economies. Hotbeds of innovation, these small businesses take leadership roles in technological change and the development of new goods and services. Just how important are small businesses to our economy? Table 5.1 provides insight into the role of small business in today’s economy.</p><p>You may be one of the millions of Americans who’s considering joining the ranks of business owners. As you read this chapter, you’ll learn why entrepreneurship continues to be one of the hottest areas of business activity. Then you’ll get the information and tools you need to help you decide whether owning your own company is the right career path for you. Next you’ll discover what characteristics you’ll need to become a successful entrepreneur. Then we’ll look at the importance of small businesses in the economy, guidelines for starting and managing a small business, the many reasons small businesses continue to thrive in the United States, and the role of the Small Business Administration. Finally, the chapter explores the trends that shape entrepreneurship and small-business ownership today.</p></p>";s:12:"availability";s:28:"{"op":"&","c":[],"showc":[]}";}}s:9:"shortname";s:3:"ITB";s:8:"fullname";s:60:"Introduction to Business: Business Management and Operations";s:6:"format";s:11:"remuiformat";s:16:"enablecompletion";s:1:"1";s:9:"groupmode";s:1:"0";s:14:"groupmodeforce";s:1:"0";s:8:"cacherev";s:10:"1704962355";}s:7:"version";i:1704962355;}
