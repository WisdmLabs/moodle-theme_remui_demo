After birth, the rate of anatomic and physiologic changes slows, but childhood is still a time of remarkable growth and development (see Physical Growth of Infants and Children). Some anatomic changes occur past adulthood, but the physiologic changes in the body’s cells and organs are what contribute most to what we experience as aging (see Changes in the Body With Aging).</p><br /><p></p>";
