Chemistry and physics are specializations of physical science. Chemistry tends to focus on the properties of substances and the interactions between different types of matter, particularly reactions that involve electrons. Physics tends to focus more on the nuclear part of the atom, as well as the subatomic realm. Really, they are two sides of the same coin.</p><p>The formal definition of chemistry is probably what you want to use if you’re asked this question on a test.</p><p>Why Study Chemistry?<br />Because understanding chemistry helps you to understand the world around you. Cooking is chemistry. Everything you can touch or taste or smell is a chemical. When you study chemistry, you come to understand a bit about how things work. Chemistry isn’t secret knowledge, useless to anyone but a scientist. It’s the explanation for everyday things, like why laundry detergent works better in hot water or how baking soda works or why not all pain relievers work equally well on a headache. If you know some chemistry, you can make educated choices about everyday products that you use.</p><p>What Fields of Study Use Chemistry?<br />You could use chemistry in most fields, but it’s commonly seen in the sciences and in medicine. Chemists, physicists, biologists, and engineers study chemistry. Doctors, nurses, dentists, pharmacists, physical therapists, and veterinarians all take chemistry courses. Science teachers study chemistry. Firefighters and people who make fireworks learn about chemistry. So do truck drivers, plumbers, artists, hairdressers, chefs… the list is extensive.</p><br /><p></p>";
